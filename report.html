### Name
Tsai, Tsung-Fang
### Introduction

My story is about the version of me who is a lawyer and an IT engineer at the same time, which I aim to be in 10 years.
Since I am very interested in psychology as well, I aslo envision myself having knowledge in this area in 10 years. Even
though it is about the version of me which I would like to be in 10 years, this website is more about a person in
fantasy because I have not evaluate how and whether it is doable or reasonable to pursue this goal, which is not the
goal of this course. Therefore, I used a nickname and called my self Alex on the website. The audience I am adressing is
mainly people who are interested in colloborating with me, and would like to get to know me thorugh this website. The
goal of this website is to provide information about me and my work and to make it possible for the audience to reach
me.

### Inspiration

I have checked out the website of Jessica Hische. Even thoough I did not know too much about this person before, I
reealised that I know a lot about her work after visiting the website. The design of the website is rather simple, yet
one could find the content he or she needs quickly on it. It provides a lot of information, but does not make the
visitor feels lost. I also find the design aesetic.


Another website I have visited is the website of Adham Dannaway. His website is very different from that of Jessica
Hische, it uses images to tell the story. I especially like the homepage because it is simple and humorous. It aslo
provides an itroduction to the website itself, which I found a good idea. I like the fact that it has panels both at the
beginning and at the bottom of the page. It makes the website more user friendly.

Vans Scheider has a website that uses a lot of animation on his website. He has some brief introduction of what this
page is about, which is needed because it is not clear what coontents each page contains. I like how he placed his own
picture on the hompage, which provides a strong impression of who he is. I tried to do the same, but with a photo which
was provided by a photographer for free. His website uses a lot of animation, which invokes me to think about how much
animation is too much for the audience.

### Accessibility
Alternative text for images: I used alt attribute for users who cannot read or see well and needs to have webpages read
to them.
Color Contrast: I chose colors for text which are contrast colors of the background colors to make sure that the
visitors could read the content on the webpages no matter which environment they are in.
Responsive layout: I used relative units like rem and % as much as possible so that the website supports resizing.
Links on the buttons: I make sure that the goal of every button is clear, and did not use general text like "click".

### Usability
Clarity: I used simple headings for each pages, so that it is clear what the page is about. I used "About", "Contact",
"Books" as my headings, which may not be creative, but it prevents the visitors from having to study my website
structure first before finding something they need.

Responsive Design: I made different layouts for different sizes of screens so that my website could be used no matter
the visitor is using a phone, a table or a desktop computer.

Consistent Layout: I made the layout consistent across different pages to prevent the visitrs from being confused and
makes sure that they could get to another page quickly.

### Learning
#### Flexbox and Grid
I learned about how to use CSS flexbox because I want my content to display in a clean and orderly way. I also find it
very useful that I could change the flex-direction if needed. I learned this by using a CSS Flexbox layout guide
(https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) . I also gained more knoledge of Grid by using a Grid layout
guide (https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/).

#### Cobination of Flexbox and Grid
To achieve the layout that I aimed to make, sometimes I combined Flexbox with Grid, I learned that the behaviors of them
may chage if combined. It was difficult for me to even adress what the problem was. After a lot of trial and errors and
searching on the web, for example: Stack Overflow, I started to understand better how to make sure that both Flexbox and
Grid behave the way that I want them to behave.

#### Javascript
I learned about high order funcions, call back functions for DOM manipulation. I did not understand the concepts and had
to learn online with videos teaching advanced javascript.

## Evaluation I
I did not know anything in web development, and I learned HTML and CSS from scratch. I consider my website to be
organised, accessible and usable (for the reasons mentioned above), which was only possible through a lot of trial,
errors and self-teaching. I like it that it is responsive because I used Media Query and structured my layout with Grid
and Flexbox . I considered which contents would be interesting to my audience and which contents are relevant to achieve
my goal of hosting my website and then present them in a way that is easy to understand. I considered what is more
comfortable for the users, and avoided using things that could be distracting, for example excessive background image.

## Evaluation II:
Next time, I would make my home page more simple and introduce the website shortly on it. I would then put the content
on my current home page on a seperate about page to keep each page more concise. I would also make more use of
javascript to make my website more "alive". I would make a better-looking panel because it would be on every page.
